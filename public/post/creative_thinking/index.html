    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The word “creativity” often brings to mind a sunlit studio where an artist in a black turtleneck throws paint on a canvas. Or a designer trying a dress made of plastic bags and violet petals on a model. Or a composer scribbling notes on a lined paper while whistling a tune. In other words, something that has nothing to do with our daily lives.</p>
<p>What my recent course on Creativity within the MBA program asserted from the beginning is that this assumption is totally wrong. Creativity is applicable in every sphere of life and by extension in every area of business - from accounting to sales, from operations to product (especially in product!). Creative thinking is critical to any situation where a solution to a problem needs to be found.</p>
<p>How to come up with new - creative - solutions is another question.</p>
<h2 id="basic-brainstorming">Basic brainstorming</h2>
<p>Our first exercise during the course consisted in thinking up 10 ways to approach a sample work situation in 30 minutes. Now, I have to confess that 10 is a lot. It’s easy to come up with the first 3-4, it takes some reflexion to get another couple, but the last ones feel like torture. Yet, it works. What this exercise demonstrates is that it is possible to get 10 potential solutions to any given problem if one has 30 minutes to focus on it. And that’s a very reassuring idea. The difficult part is not to give up after the first few options and persist throughout the entire exercise. In a way, it reminds of Crazy 8’s - a Design Sprint method which challenges participants to sketch eight distinct ideas in eight minutes, although in this case it is not accompanied by the rest of the Design Sprint method.</p>
<h2 id="pages-framework">PAGES framework</h2>
<p>While the above method works, we were suggested to apply a more structured approach called <strong>PAGES</strong> (based on Matthew Cronin and Jeffrey Loewenstein’s forthcoming book, The Craft of Creativity, Stanford University Press). The abbreviation stands for Parts, Actions, Goals, Events and Self-Concept.
The process consists in considering the known or basic aspects of the situation for each one of the P-A-G-E-S elements and then try to change these aspects or add something new. For example, let’s say a manager has an employee who consistently arrives late.</p>
<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>
<p>To brainstorm on the solutions, the manager would start by building a basic list:</p>
<p>Firstly, <strong>Parts</strong> of the situation: the manager, the employee, company rules, other colleagues …</p>
<p>Then <strong>Actions</strong>: prepare for the meeting, talk to the employee, give feedback, issue a warning …</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong>: the manager could consider her own goals and the employee’s goals here. Let’s say the manager&rsquo;s goal is to get her team to deliver work on time, get a good reputation in the company, maybe get a promotion. Employee’s goal (from the manager&rsquo;s perspective if she’s very angry) could be to pass the time by and get a paycheck at the end of the month.</p>
<p><strong>Events</strong>: for example, failed project delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Concept</strong>: this one is very important - what does the manager see herself as in this situation and in her life? A hands-on boss, an inspiring leader, a support for her team?</p>
<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>
<p>After the initial list is built, the manager needs to go back to each element and try to add more items to the list which will lead her to reconsider the situation.</p>
<p>For example, returning to Parts: what if she adds family to it? Could it be that the employee is late because he has a family struggle and doesn’t feel confident to discuss it at work? What would the manager’s Actions be in that case?</p>
<p>With every new aspect, the situation gets shifted as a kaleidoscope forming new and unexpected patterns.</p>
<p>There are two elements of PAGES that particularly tend to change the picture: it’s Goals and Self-concept. Changing one’s goals and changing one’s self-concepts makes you look at the problem from a completely new angle and come up with an unexpected solution. In fact, based on my limited experience in using this framework, I’d advise to start turning the kaleidoscope from the Self-concept. The manager would approach the situation differently if she thinks of herself as a demanding but fair boss or as an inspirational female leader or a mother of three.</p>
<p>Note that the framework does not include evaluation of the generated ideas. Of course, once the exercise is done, one has to select some ideas and discard others. However, it’s a good method to be creative in generating solutions for any type of problem.</p>
