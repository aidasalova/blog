      <description>I took on skiing as an adult having never skied until then. The cold crisp air of the mountain, the snow sparkling under the sun, the silence is what attracted me.
Any person starting to ski in their mid-life knows the feeling of admiration and jealousy towards kids who fearlessly zip forward on the steep routes. Being adults, we carry too much baggage - anxiety, fear, ego, what-ifsâ€¦
One of the things that is particularly difficult for someone new to skiing is to lean towards the abyss.</description>
