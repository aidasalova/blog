Scrum is an agile framework aimed to address complex problems and especially widely used in software development, although Scrum can really be applied in any sphere. And while Scrum is famously difficult to master, this short article is aimed to cover the very basics of what it represents.

The heart of Scrum is a **transparent collaboration** of a **self-organizing** small group of people who hold specific **roles** within this group, **continuously inspect** the environment and **adapt** to it to deliver the maximum **value** in an **iterative** fashion. 

## Scrum Team

The Scrum team is self-organizing and cross-functional. It consists of:

- **Scrum Master** who ensures that the Scrum framework is adhered to and removes impediments for the Development Team;

- **Product Owner** who understands the client needs and prioritizes the items of work to maximize the value;

- **Development Team** who execute the work. There’s no such concept here as a development team member, senior or junior person - the entire team is treated as a single entity and this has a deep significance: the Development team works as one organism jointly accountable for its work. 

## How it works

The Scrum team operates in 2 to 4 week fixed timeboxes - **Sprints** - to deliver a product version - Increment - which could be potentially released to customers. The increment does not *have* to be released, but it must be in a state of “**done**ness” (defined beforehand) which allows the Product Owner to make it available to customers.



The goal for the Sprint is defined and the work is planned at a **Sprint Planning** meeting. This planning activity is based on the **Product Backlog** which is an ever-changing list of functionalities defined and prioritized by the Product Owner and that will maximize Product value for the customer. From this list, the Development Team select into the **Sprint Backlog** those items that will allow it to produce the Increment and meet the Sprint Goal. 
During the Sprint, the Development Team meet for **Daily Scrums** to discuss what has been done in the last 24 hours and organize their work for the next 24 hours. 
The increment achieved as a result of the Sprint is presented to stakeholders at the **Sprint Review** and their feedback is discussed. 
A very important element of Scrum is **Sprint Retrospective** which is an honest and open discussion of the Scrum Team (no people from outside of the team are allowed) of what went well and not so well during the last Sprint with the aim to carry out at least one improvement in the next Sprint.

There are of course many more details to the framework which are discussed in more depth in the Scrum Guide. It’s important to note that all Scrum elements are of high significance: although skipping a couple might seem of no consequence, this will derail the value of Scrum. 

Overall, the entire mechanics may appear simple enough but it is not at all easy to achieve what Scrum means to achieve: self-organization, openness and constant drive to maximize value.
