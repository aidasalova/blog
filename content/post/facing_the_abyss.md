I took on skiing as an adult having never skied until then. The cold crisp air of the mountain, the snow sparkling under the sun, the silence is what attracted me.

Any person starting to ski in their mid-life knows the feeling of admiration and jealousy towards kids who fearlessly zip forward on the steep routes. Being adults, we carry too much baggage - anxiety, fear, ego, what-ifs… 

One of the things that is particularly difficult for someone new to skiing is to lean towards the abyss. A skier has a choice of tilting the body uphill or downhill. Uphill looks safe and nice, the surface is close, falling seems not so bad. Downhill is where the scary stuff is - a bottomless pit into which to fall, forever and ever. And so a newbie skier would lean uphill which is a dangerous mistake causing uncontrollable sliding. Despite what our mind tells us, tilting the body down towards the valley is necessary in order to have proper support, alignment, balance, and so, in the end, to be safer. And then, once you force yourself to put your body weight downhill you realize that high speed is not so bad because suddenly there’s a feeling of control. 

While on a skiing holiday last week, I was thinking about how true it is of life in general. What appears to be safe in the long run puts us in more danger - staying at the wrong job, avoiding a difficult conversation, postponing an important decision, or clinging to a relationship that doesn’t work. Ultimately, it’s only by facing the abyss of life, and leaning and speeding forward that we can take control, prosper and enjoy the ride.
