Creating a smooth experience for end users, tapping into undiscovered needs and bringing efficiency into old-fashioned workflows is a multi-step process that involves an equal share of analytical skills, ingenuity, experience and intuition. 

This task is all the more difficult because - as probably many of us discovered during these pandemic times - after a while we get used to everything. So we stop paying attention to annoying or simply unnecessary aspects of our life and take it as a given that the status quo is the only alternative possible. Just think about how strange it seemed in the beginning to wear a mask all the time and now it feels like the most normal thing in the world.

To break through the wall of habit, there is a somewhat strongly-worded technique called **“Well, it really sucks that…”**

## How it works

For example, let’s say that I want to improve how my breakfasts happen. Every morning, at about 8.30 am, I open my fridge and spend about 3 minutes looking at the food stock available. I’d pick a few things and take them out. I also get some bread and a cutting board. Then I grind coffee. And so on and so forth... 

To begin with, I need to ask myself what’s the **ultimate value** of this process? It’s not a trivial question, many things that are done every day and consume resources in the end bring no particular value to the end customer. If value cannot be identified, then it’s worth considering to kill the process altogether. In the case of breakfast, its value is that I have consumed enough nutrients to survive until lunch without a hangriness attack.

Once the beginning, the end, and the steps in-between are drawn out, I will go item by item and ask the user - i.e. myself in this case - what is the **value** of each step and provided it really holds any value, what **sucks** about it. So, if I consider the step of looking through the food in the fridge and picking up some food:

- Does it hold value? Yes, it does because to have breakfast I need to get the ingredients first. This means I cannot eliminate the step (but maybe I could replace it by looking for in the cupboard instead);

- Given that it has value, what sucks about it? Well, it really sucks that it takes me a considerable time and desperation to decide what to eat for breakfast. It also sucks that I end up eating the same things every day because I don’t have time to come up with something different. 

Now that I know what sucks about it, I can think about how this step should ideally look like and finally, what solution could help me (from a fancy app with random breakfast suggestions to some old-fashioned food planning). 

Translate this process to a business environment and you can methodically review existing workflows and solutions and also come up with new products for your customers. Depending on your users, “it suck that … “ can be replaced by something milder like “It is annoying that …“.

## Is that it?

Not at all! 

Firstly, it is vital to analyze the available data. Otherwise, the danger is to develop a solution that would ultimately be only of marginal importance, for example because it only improves the experience for a handful of users. In addition, there is a lot of subjectivity about how people describe their process - it’s not bad by itself, but objective data must complement it. 

Secondly, not everything that sucks has to be improved - it might suck that my toaster doesn’t give me a weather forecast, but it doesn’t mean I’m ready to pay for a fancier one. The question of cost and benefit now comes into light, but that’s a topic for another post.
