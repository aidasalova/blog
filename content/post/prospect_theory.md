It can be frustrating sometimes. Designing a new feature with the expectation that excited users will thank you for the great new stuff … only to discover that users couldn’t care less about it. 

The **prospect theory** developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky might have a good explanation for this. According to this theory, when faced with a choice (e.g. use a new feature, buy a new product) people think in terms of their gains and losses with respect to a reference point rather than in absolute terms. Combined with the **endowment effect** and **loss aversion** explained by Kahneman and his colleagues, this framework is useful to remember when introducing anything new.

## So what does it mean?

Let’s say there’s a fancy new start-up that has designed a super toaster and is advertising it to me. Let’s say that this toaster never burns the bread, can sing a good morning song and suggest an excuse to skip that 9am meeting with your boss. Sounds good, right? Not so fast. According to the prospect theory, we don’t assess gains and losses of a new product in a vacuum, but rather by comparing it to all the other options we currently have, i.e. our reference point. For example, if my old toaster can toast the bread at least with a reasonable quality, and my husband can sing an acceptable good morning song, and I actually enjoy having a 9am meeting with my boss, then what’s my gain in buying this fancy new apparatus? Not a lot, in fact. And it's really intuitive, but yet it's easy to focus on the absolute value alone. 

Unfortunately, this is only part of the story.

The prospect theory shows that users’ sensitivity to the new features quickly diminishes, while on the other hand, losses loom very large, MUCH larger than gains. Spending a hundred bucks on a new toaster and having to go through the inconvenience of learning the new functionalities (i.e. adopting new behaviors) subjectively creates a significantly larger pain than the joy of getting any new fancy feature.

Apart from that, due to the endowment effect, we value what we currently have about three times more than its real worth and therefore my old toaster will seem much more dearer to me if I think of replacing it.

So unless the startup can convince me that the new toaster is at the very least 3 times better than my existing options and can minimize any pains from making the change, it’s unlikely I’m going to buy it. What is interesting here, however, is that the startup founders suffer from the same endowment effect and their product appears to them to be three times better than what it actually is. The result? A 9x gap between the seller and the buyer. 

In conclusion, it is important to minimize the perceived losses of abandoning the existing product for users, understanding value from their standpoint and making the transition as easy as possible. On the other hand, for those who develop the product it’s useful to remember that they might be grossly overestimating its value.
