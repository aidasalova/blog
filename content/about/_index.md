Welcome to my page! It is going to cover a variety of topics about management, product, technology and everything in-between.

I would define myself as learner and doer. 

I am passionate about creating amazing products, intuitive user journeys and clean processes driven by quantitative and qualitative analysis, research methodologies and pragmatic approach.

I am also a firm believer in self-organizing teams, in building trustful relationships and designing opportunities for collaboration and decision-making.

I hold a degree in Psychology and an MBA.

Born and raised in Kazakhstan, I've lived in sunny Barcelona for over a decade. I love beach and mountain walks and am an amateur piano-player.
