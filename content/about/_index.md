Welcome to my page! It is going to cover a variety of topics about management, product, technology and everything in-between.

I would define myself as learner and doer. 

I have worked for several years managing talented teams, ideating and owning products to create efficient processes and leading cross-functional projects. I am an MBA candidate about to complete the program.

I am passionate about creating clean processes, intuitive user journeys and value-maximizing products driven by quantitative and qualitative analysis, research methodologies and pragmatic approach.

I am also a firm believer in self-organizing teams, in building trustful relationships and designing opportunities for collaboration and decision-making

Born and raised in Kazakhstan, I've lived in sunny Barcelona for over a decade. I love beach and mountain walks and am an amateur (alas!) piano-player.
